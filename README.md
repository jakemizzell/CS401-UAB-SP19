# CS401: Programming Languages
This is my repo from when I took CS401 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in Spring 2019 with Thomas Gilray

I passed all the test for the labs. 

To give you an idea of how well each repo works these are the grades I made on each project. 
Some projects had parts that were extra credit so I put my test pass percentage on them in paretheses when applicable
