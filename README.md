# CS401: Programming Languages
This is my repo from when I took CS401 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in Spring 2019 with Thomas Gilray

I passed all the test for the labs. 

To give you an idea of how well each repo works these are the grades I made on each project. 
Some projects had parts that were extra credit so I put my test pass percentage on them in paretheses when applicable

* Project 0: C++ lists and array ; 100% (100%)
* Project 1: C++ allocation, inheritance, virtual tables ; 63.6% (100%)
* Project 2: JavaScript IMP interpreter ; 100%
* Project 3: Exercises in Racket ; 95.2% (28.5%)
* Project 4: Church Encoding in Racket ; 100% (100%)
* Project 5: Continuation-passing style (CPS) conversion in Racket ; 100% (0%)
* Project 6: Bottom-up closure creation in Racket ; 66.7%
* Project 7: Reverseo in MiniKanren ; 100%
